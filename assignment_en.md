# Analysis of Winning Strategies in Nim Game

## Problem Statement

Consider the classical Nim game. There are `n` piles, each containing some number of stones. Two players take turns making moves. In one move, a player can choose one pile and remove any non-zero number of stones from it. The player who takes the last stone wins.

**Task:** For a given pile configuration, determine which player has a winning strategy when both players play optimally.

## Requirements

1. Study the theoretical foundations of the Nim game
2. Prove the criterion for a winning position
3. Develop an algorithm for determining the winning strategy
4. Provide examples of the algorithm's operation

## Solution Format

- Mathematical proof of the theorem
- Algorithm for determining the winning strategy
- Examples for various pile configurations
